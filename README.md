# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Overview

This activity presents a real-world situation in which my newfound JavaScript skills will came in handy. I was tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. 


The task was to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.
